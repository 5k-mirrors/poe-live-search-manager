# Poe::Sniper

#### Desktop tool for Path of Exile to make instant offers for listed items without leaving the game.

It is an alternative to keeping several browser tabs open but it consumes far less resources and you donâ€™t need to switch between the game and the browser tabs all the time. You can use custom search criteria and message the seller instantly in-game.

Supported trade sites:
- [pathofexile.com/trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/)

*You are viewing the README of version [v1.0.1](https://github.com/thisismydesign/poe-sniper/releases/tag/v1.0.1) which is a completely new app with [pathofexile.com/trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/) support and a graphical interface. GitHub is only used to host releases and issues. You can find the old app and other releases [here](https://github.com/thisismydesign/poe-sniper/releases).*

## Caveats

- PoE needs to run in windowed or windowed fullscreen mode for the notifications to show while in-game
- Your clipboard will be altered with every new whisper message (can be turned off)
