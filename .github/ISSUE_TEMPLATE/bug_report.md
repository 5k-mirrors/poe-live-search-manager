Hey,

Sorry that something didn't work out and thanks for coming here to report it.

Before you do, take a look at
- the troubleshooting chapter: https://github.com/5k-mirrors/poe-live-search-manager#troubleshooting
- existing issues: https://github.com/5k-mirrors/poe-live-search-manager/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue

Otherwise try to describe your issue as detailed as possible providing as much information as you can, including:
- the version you're using
- screenshots
- when and how often does it happen

Make sure to create separate issues per topic, therefore it's easier to keep the discussion on point.

I will get back to you as soon as possible.
