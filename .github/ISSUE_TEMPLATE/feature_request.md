Hey,

Thanks for sharing your request / idea / use case.

Before posting, take a look at existing ones: https://github.com/5k-mirrors/poe-live-search-manager/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature+request%22

Otherwise, describe what you'd like to achieve as detailed as possible. Proposing a use case is better than proposing a solution, as there can be multiple good solutions.

Make sure to create separate issues per topic so it's easier to keep the discussion on point.

We will get back to you as soon as possible.
