    description: `Keep the tool alive and growing! In the past year, new features were created by paid developers. You can now support us via the [Sponsor button](https://github.com/sponsors/thisismydesign) on [GitHub](https://github.com/5k-mirrors/poe-live-search-manager).

All contributions go toward improving the tool. If you have a specific feature request, or any questions, feel free to reach out at [git.thisismydesign@gmail.com](mailto:git.thisismydesign@gmail.com).

This is similar to Patreon but GitHub doesn't take a cut, rather initially they will even [match your contribution](https://help.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund).`,
